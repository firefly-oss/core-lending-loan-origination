## Overview

The **Core Lending Loan Origination Microservice** is a critical component of the **Firefly OpenCore Banking Platform**, developed by **Firefly Software Solutions Inc** under the Apache 2.0 license. This microservice is responsible for managing the complete loan origination process, from initial application submission through underwriting decisions and scoring.

This service handles loan applications, application parties, documents, proposed offers, underwriting decisions, scoring, and status history tracking. It provides a comprehensive solution for financial institutions to manage their loan origination workflows efficiently.

**Note:** Collateral management is handled by the separate `core-lending-collateral-management` microservice, which maintains references to loan applications via `loanApplicationId`.

**Built with modern technologies:**
- **Java 25** with virtual threads for enhanced performance
- **Spring Boot 3.x** with **Spring WebFlux** for reactive programming
- **Spring Data R2DBC** for reactive database access
- **PostgreSQL** with **Flyway** for database migrations
- **OpenAPI 3.0** for API documentation

## Architecture

The microservice follows a **reactive programming model** using Project Reactor (Mono/Flux) for efficient handling of asynchronous operations and high throughput. It is structured as a multi-module Maven project with clear separation of concerns:

### Module Structure

1. **core-lending-loan-origination-interfaces**
   - Contains DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), enums, and validation annotations
   - Defines the contract between the microservice and its clients
   - Includes OpenAPI/Swagger documentation annotations

2. **core-lending-loan-origination-models**
   - Contains JPA entity definitions and R2DBC repository interfaces
   - Manages database interactions and data persistence
   - Includes Flyway database migration scripts

3. **core-lending-loan-origination-core**
   - Contains business logic and service implementations
   - Implements the core functionality of the microservice
   - Handles transaction management and business rules

4. **core-lending-loan-origination-web**
   - Contains REST controllers and API endpoints
   - Manages HTTP requests and responses using Spring WebFlux
   - Implements API versioning and documentation

5. **core-lending-loan-origination-sdk**
   - Auto-generated client SDK from OpenAPI specification
   - Provides type-safe client libraries for consuming the API

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Loan Application Management**: Full CRUD operations for loan applications
- **Multi-Party Support**: Handle primary applicants, co-applicants, and guarantors
- **Document Management**: Track mandatory and optional documents with receipt status
- **Proposed Offers**: Manage loan offers with terms and validity periods
- **Underwriting Decisions**: Record approval/rejection decisions with risk grades
- **Scoring System**: Evaluate and score loan applications with reason codes
- **Status History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of application status changes
- **Reactive Programming**: Non-blocking I/O for high throughput and scalability
- **RESTful API**: Well-documented API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Pagination and Filtering**: Advanced querying capabilities with pagination support

## Data Model

The microservice uses a comprehensive data model designed to handle all aspects of loan origination. The system uses **UUID primary keys** for all entities and **PostgreSQL enums** for type-safe categorical data.
